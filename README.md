# My Lichess Games - Well-being Relation Analysis

## Description

DSA 210 Fall 2024-25 Project

## Motivation

I am interested in playing chess for many years, and I have a Lichess account since November 2018. Over the years, chess has been an integral part of my life, offering both a source of joy and a means of reflection. With this project, I aim to explore how my chess games relate to my well-being, including factors such as my stress level, workload, and attention span, as well as the times of day when I play.

I also aim to analyze general statistics about my gameplay, such as:

- Average time spent per move
- Win/loss rates and streaks
- Positional tendencies of my pieces

By conducting this analysis, I hope to gain insights into my playstyle, identify patterns, and make better decisions both in chess and in life. Specifically, I will focus on the following aspects:

- ELO Rating Dynamics: Comparing my rating with those of my opponents.
- Time of Day: Investigating performance variations across different parts of the day (morning, afternoon, evening, night).
- Positional Tendencies: Analyzing the average positioning of my pieces using heatmaps.
- Time Usage: Examining the average time spent per move and its correlation with game outcomes.
- Yearly Analysis: Relating game performance to significant life events over the years.
- Proximity to Exam Dates: Assessing the impact of academic stress on gameplay.
- Lecture-Time Games: Comparing the outcomes of games played during lectures with those played at other times.
- Performance After Breaks: Analyzing whether long intervals without playing chess correlate with a decline in performance upon returning.

Through these analyses, I aim to understand how external factors and life circumstances influence my chess performance and to use these findings to improve my decision-making skills, both in chess and beyond.
